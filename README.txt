INSTALLATION
------------------

We think this is pretty simple, but just in case:

UPGRADING
----------------

The latest version of THT can only be upgraded on top of the release directly before it.

GETTING HELP
-------------------

We have our own IRC channel, #tht on freenode. It rarely gets used but try popping in there once and see if anybody is around. The best way to get support is by posting on our forums. Please refrain from emailing team members with THT related support questions as they are best handled on the forum.
